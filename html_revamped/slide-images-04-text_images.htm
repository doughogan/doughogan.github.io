<h2><font color="#336600">Text Images and Capturing Graphics </font></h2><p>There are times on web pages when we'd like to put text in interesting fonts or achieve special formatting, such as for logos and the like. Since these fonts may not be available on all systems, using them in the HTML is dangerous. Instead, it's better to build the text in the format we want it and save it as an image instead. </p><p>There are many professional graphics tools out there to create graphics the right way. Photoshop is perhaps the best one. Unfortunately, it's not installed on our lab computers. Note that iPhoto provides some Photo Editing capabilities. </p><p>As for making graphics from text, we'll experiment with this using the tools we do have: the Office software. While it's not particularly ideal, it is possible to create interesting text effects in programs like Word and PowerPoint and take a picture of it to insert on our pages. We call what results a <em>screen shot</em>; we'll learn how below. </p><p>There are places where using screen shots may be the best way to achieve certain formats on the web. For example, it's not easy and it's sometimes impossible to format mathematical equations that are even slightly interesting in HTML. If we don't want to go to the trouble of learning MathML, a quick way to get a professional-looking equation on a site is to create it in Word using Equation Editor and take a screen shot. There is a drawback: the image version of the text is static, so it cannot be resized in the browser. </p><h3><font color="#336600">Taking Screen Shots </font></h3><p>In Mac OS X, there are two commands for taking screen shots:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Apple + Shift + 3</strong> takes a screen shot of the entire screen.</li>  <li><strong>Apple + Shift + 4</strong> brings up a tool that allows you to select part of the screen to take a picture of. Position the mouse where you want the top left to be and drag it to the desired bottom right position. </li></ul><p>Both commands save the result to the desktop in <strong>png</strong> format. Never fear! You can double-click these files to open them in <strong>Preview</strong>. There, you can use the <strong>Save As</strong> command to give them web-friendly, descriptive filenames and convert them to <strong>jpg</strong> format. (Remember to clean up the desktop when you're done.) </p><p>In Windows, there are also two commands for taking screen shots: </p><ul>  <li><strong>PrintScreen </strong>takes a screen shot of the entire screen.</li>  <li><strong>Alt + PrintScreen</strong> takes a screen shot of just the active window.</li></ul><p>Both commands store the screen shot on the clipboard. You'd need to paste it into photo editing software to save it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font color="#336600">A Word on Ethics</font></h3><p>Files on the web aren't free for the taking; there are ownership issues. <strong>Do not copy and use images from other people's sites without their permission</strong>. There are some sources of images that are in the public domain. For such images, it's a good idea to cite the source. (Alt text is a fine place.) You must be absolutely sure you're not violating any laws or the wishes of whoever created an image before posting it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
