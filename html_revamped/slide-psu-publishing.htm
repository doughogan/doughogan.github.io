<h2><font color="#336600">Publishing to the PSU Web Space</font></h2><p>First, you need to <a href="https://www.work.psu.edu/webspace">apply for your PSU web space</a>. You may have to wait up to a week to get a confirmation that your space has been created. </p><p>The space you have is on a server that's connected to the Internet. You'll   store all the files you want to be your webpage on the server. </p><p>There are a few ways to access your space. We'll go over two here: </p><h3><font color="#336600">Getting to your space via the web anywhere</font></h3><p>You can get to your space anywhere via the <a href="https://portal.psu.edu/">Penn State Portal</a>, as follows:</p><ol>  <li>Open a web browser and go to <a href="https://portal.psu.edu/">https://portal.psu.edu/</a>.</li>  <li>Click <b>Login</b> in the top left.</li>  <li>Enter your PSU username and password. </li>  <li>Look for the section titled <b>Penn State Access Account Storage Space</b>. It's in the middle in the defualt layout (I think, unless I configured it...).</li>  <li>Click on the link labeled <b>PASS Explorer</b>.</li></ol><p>At this point, you'll see a web interface for doing file management operations and all of the files in your web space. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font color="#336600">Getting to your space in ITS Windows labs </font></h3><p>You'll treat your web space as if it's another drive, specifically a <b>network   drive</b>. You need to tell Windows how to find your space, which is called   <b>mapping a network drive</b>:</p><ol>  <li>Right-click the <b>My Computer </b>icon on your desktop.</li>  <li>Select <b>Map Network Drive</b>.</li>  <li>In the pull-down menu labeled <b>Drive</b>, choose <b>W</b>. </li>  <li>In the <b>Folder</b> field, type <b>\\SAMBA.CAC.PSU.EDU\HOMES</b>. </li>  <li>Check <b>Reconnect at Logon</b>. </li>  <li>Click <b>Finish</b>. </li>  <li>You may be asked to enter your username and password. If so, they're the     same PSU username and password. </li></ol><p>The <b>W</b> drive now exists as an option in <b>My Computer</b>. You can use   it just like any other drive (except that deleted files do NOT go to the Recycle   Bin from here.)</p><p>For problems and anything not covered here, see the <a href="https://www.work.psu.edu/pass/instructions.shtml">Directions   from ITS</a>.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><font color="#336600">Using It</font></h3><ul>  <li>There's a folder called <b>www</b> in your <b>W</b> drive or PASS account.     <ul>      <li>Put all the files you want to have on your web site within this folder.</li>      <li>Everything within this folder is visibile to anyone on the Internet.       </li>      <li>You can make folders within this folder that are also visible.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Your web page URL will be of the form <b>http://www.personal.psu.edu/abc123/</b>.     <ul>      <li>Everything that's in the <b>www</b> folder is directly accessible at         this location. </li>      <li>Ex: If you have a file called <b>schedule.htm</b> in the <b>www </b>folder,         its URL is <b>http://www.personal.psu.edu/abc123/schedule.htm</b>.</li>      <li>If no filename after slash, the default file <b>index.html</b> or <b>index.htm</b>         is displayed. (Every folder should have one!)</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>In Windows, use the drag-and-drop methods to put your files in <b>W:\www</b>.   In PASS, use the appropriate buttons. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><h3><font color="#336600">Keeping web servers happy</font></h3><ul>  <li>Never use spaces in filenames; separate words with underscores instead</li>  <li>Never use capital letters in filenames</li>  <li>Never use special characters in filenames</li></ul><p>Basic file naming convention: letter followed by one or more letters, numbers,   or underscores followed by a dot followed by an extension</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
