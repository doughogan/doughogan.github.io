<h2><font color="#336600">HTML &amp; Abstraction </font></h2><p>Abstraction is one the most fundamental concepts of computer science.</p><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ignoring the details of a complicated system to focus on the essentials needed to use the system. Focusing on WHAT we're doing, not HOW it is done. </p><p>Where do we use abstraction in our daily lives?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HTML is a great example of abstraction in action. When we look at a web page in a browser, we are viewing the same thing as the HTML code, but at a different (higher) level of abstraction. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
