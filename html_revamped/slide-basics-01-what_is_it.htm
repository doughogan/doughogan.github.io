<h2><font color="#336600">What is it?</font></h2><p><b>HTML =</b> <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> is the <i>markup language</i>   used for <i>hypertext</i> (yeah, that says very little...)</p><p>A <b>markup language</b> is a system of <i>tags</i> that describe how to format   a document. There's usually some kind of <i>interpreter</i> that reads a document   in the markup language and displays it in a nicely formatted way. </p><p><b>Hypertext</b> is the technical term for web pages, i.e. text with formatting   and which the user can interact with (e.g. clicking links, hence the &quot;hyper&quot;   part). The interpreter for hypertext is a <i>web browser</i>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font color="#336600">Tags and HTML Files</font></h3><p>HTML files are plain text files --&gt; no formatting </p><p>We need ways to tell the web browser when to start formatting text in certain   ways, insert things like horizontal rules and links, etc. These are the <b>tags</b>.   They're code that is understood by the writer and replaced by the interpreter   with appropriate formatting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font color="#336600">Putting it in Perspective</font></h3><p>HTML is not the only markup language. Just a few other examples:</p><ul>  <li><b>LaTeX</b> -- a markup language used for typesetting mathematics; interpreter     eventually produces a printed document</li>  <li><b>MathML</b> -- another markup language for math that's designed to be     integrated with HTML and read by web browsers (Update: it's supported by Firefox, Safari, 
    Chrome, Camino, and Opera now.)</li>  <li><b>XML</b> -- eXtended markup language, also used for the web, but the theory     is to markup <i>what</i> something is and not how to format it; formatting     handled separately</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
