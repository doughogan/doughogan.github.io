  <h1>Introdutory Python Notes</h1>

  <p>These are class notes I developed for an introduction to computational thinking course some years
  back. In addtion to several conceptual topics and applications, the course had introductions to four
  technologies with code: HTML, Excel formulas, Python, and SQL. These notes assume some background 
  covered in the HTML and Excel formulas sections. In particular, the prior section is where conditional
  logic is introduced. In addition, my course design had conceptual introductions to concepts like
  searching and sorting come up before the classes that used these notes.</p>
