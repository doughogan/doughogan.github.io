songs i've been listening to this year that haven't been on the radio or
anything else like that<br>
the above list of albums has certainly influenced this list<br>
anything that's in the top 100 of the year or which has ever been on the top 30
has been disqualified<br>
with some random commentary and
interesting/bizarre/catchy/why-you-might-know-the-song/whatever lyrics
too...&nbsp;<br>
(and i'm aware of the fact that i seem to have given about half the song for the
first half and then gotten lazier with the lyrics
around the halfway point...)</font></h2>

  beneath the golden sky, cities roll on by and i can't get no sleep<br>
  when i'm alone sometimes, i try to understand what things have meaning<br>
  and i despise myself, for being such a fake, my mind goes on for miles and
  miles...<br>
  sail away, with the sea as my engine and the stars as my guide<br>
  sailing to the other side...<br>
  on a starry night, walking home in silence while the city sleeps<br>
  i try to do what's right, but something in my nature's trying to ruin me<br>
  i look out to the sea, a thousand just like me, needing direction<br>
  just floating out of sight, into the failing light, as if it's just the way
  my life is meant to be</font></font></td>
