       <h1>Name That Tune Tie-Breaker Blitz</h1>

       <p>Notes:</p>
       <ul>  
          <li>Use the Google Form as before. Call it Round <b>5</b>.</li>
          <li>The idea was that I wasn't planning on explaining the extra things in
              clues during the game, but if someone asked or someone said something in
              chat, well then, the playing field is still level. By all means, use it.</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>The questions:</h2>

       <ol>

          <li>Who sang the lead-in tune, "Living in the Moment"? </li>
          <li>Who sang "80s Love Song"? 
              (This is obscure, but maybe you recognize the voice.)</li>
          <li>Who first sang "The Best"?</li>
          <li>Who sang the 1989 "Heaven?"</li>
          <li>What was Selena's breakthrough hit?</li>
          <li>What was the other TLC song the slide hinted at? </li>
          <li>Who sang "Right Here, Right Now?"</li>
          <li>I spoke of a Brand New video with the same sheep as in "Ocean Avenue." 
              What was the song?</li>
          <li>What other Tears For Fears song was hinted at in the clue?</li>

      </ol>
