  (a) there are plenty of songs on here that weren't REALLY released in 2002, 
  but they're close and this is when i discovered 'em...although, most of 'em 
  are the artist's most current releases<br>
  (b) i overdid the lyrics at the beginning and got lazier as time went on...or 
  was it that the songs in the top 10 are just too quotable<br>
  (c) the rankings aren't perfect and you could probably convince me that i liked 
  number <i>n</i> a lot better than <i>n+1</i> and i should rerank 'em, but i'm 
  not going to because it's not supposed to be that serious; it's supposed to 
  be fun... <br>
