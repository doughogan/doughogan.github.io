  Top 15 CDs of 2003</font></h2>
<p class="commentary">Seven years ago, MTV was still doing a cool show called 
  &quot;120 Minutes&quot; and I tuned in one December evening hoping to catch 
  the premiere of the Smashing Pumpkins' video for &quot;Thirty-Three.&quot; As 
  a result of those two hours, I ended up getting two other CDs. One was Fountains 
  of Wayne's self-titled release due to my inability to get &quot;Radiation Vibe&quot; 
  out of my head. Off the wall lyrics were commonplace on that album, much like 
  the title above which leads off the band's 2003 release <i>Welcome Interstate 
  Managers. </i>Perhaps it's fitting that a song like &quot;Stacy's Mom&quot; 
  got this band known in the mainstream, but it's definitely not the only good 
  song on the album. It's spent enough time in my car's CD player to earn it the 
  runner-up position on this year's album chart. I figured the band earning top 
  honors on this list got to have a title somewhere else, so F.O.W. gets the title 
  here. My lists, my rules. :)</p>
<p class="commentary">As for the very best... It's not all that common that I 
  have the radio on these days. It's not all that common that I call a radio station. 
  It's not all that common that Something Corporate gets noticed on the radio. 
  Maybe that's why I had to find out exactly <i>what</i> that great song was called 
  the first time I heard &quot;I Woke Up In a Car&quot; in September 2002. Needless 
  to say, I fell in love with the song. (The fact that it's placed in the top 
  20 singles of <b>both</b> 2002 and 2003 ought to be evidence of that!) When 
  I posted my year-end lists last December, a friend who was happy to see Something 
  Corporate on the list recommended some of the band's other songs to me. (Thanks, 
  Adam!) A few days later, I picked up a copy of <i>Leaving Through the Window</i>, 
  and I've since become a big fan. This album is the best representative of the 
  Something Corporate sound: &quot;I Want to Save You,&quot; &quot;I Woke up in 
  a Car,&quot; and &quot;Straw Dog&quot; showcase the band's upbeat songs, while 
  &quot;Cavanaugh Park&quot; and &quot;Globes and Maps&quot; are beautiful ballads 
  that exemplify that side of the band. Even though you'll need more than just 
  this CD to hear all of Something Corporate's great songs, it's this one that 
  made me a fan. For that reason, I can't think of any disc that's more deserving 
  of being the Number One album of 2003. The band's newest album, <i>North</i>, 
  was released in October and also earns a respectable place in the top five. 
</p>
<p class="commentary">Come to think of it, there's no rule that the same artist 
  has to top the album's list and the &quot;unreleased&quot; list, but I've been 
  doing these lists for three years and that's happened all three years. The Dum 
  Dums did in 2001 and John Mayer did it last year. Mayer's sophomore release 
  lands at Number Four this year. While it doesn't come close to comparing to 
  last year's <i>Room For Squares</i>, it's quite a decent disc. </p>
<p class="commentary">Not surprisingly, Yellowcard also places in the top five 
  with its major-label debut and what I claim is its best album overall. &quot;Way 
  Away&quot; is a good choice of single for a great album like <i>Ocean Avenue</i> 
  (and yes, I'm still thrilled I got to see Yellowcard live and meet the band...)</p>

  spell out the digits in that one band's name... </p>
