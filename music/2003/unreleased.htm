  Best Songs of 2003 That <i>Weren't</i> on the Radio</font></h2>
<p class="commentary">So this is that list I do every year that I don't quite 
  know what to call. They're those songs I loved and listened to perhaps even 
  more than the ones that make the top 100 singles list; they're the B-sides and 
  album tracks that I loved; they're the songs that someone told me to check out 
  and I love; they're the songs that unknown opening acts did at shows and got 
  stuck in my head; they're songs that are nine years old but I discovered thanks 
  to campus a capella bands. They're not even necessarily all songs made this 
  year, but the point is that I <i>discovered </i>them this year. Whatever you 
  want to call the list, these are the best of those songs. </p>
<p class="commentary">The number one song on this list should be no surprise to 
  anyone who knows me well. It's a nine-and-a-half minute ballad that can't be 
  found on any of Something Corporate's CDs (okay, imports excluded -- and now 
  I need to buy another CD...), but it's undoubtedly the band's best work. The 
  band is also undoubtedly my favorite of the year, as you might guess by its 
  dominance of this list with 11 entries. Likewise, the runner-up is another rarity. 
  I discovered it when I saw Yellowcard live in September. You can finally get 
  it on a real CD (the rereleased version of their first CD, <i>One for the Kids</i>.) 
  Yellowcard ties Fountains of Wayne for the second biggest number of entries 
  here with six each. </p>
<p class="commentary">Aside from the obscure stuff that I doubt will ever make 
  it on the radio, there are the album tracks that make it on this list too. Some 
  of them may surface on radio and hit it big next year. In fact, I've heard rumors 
  that &quot;Mexican Wine&quot; and &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; are supposed to be 
  released as singles soon, but they get to be on this list because they were 
  album tracks first. Simple Plan's &quot;Perfect&quot; would've been in the top 
  10 had it not gone to radio; instead it earns a respectable placement on the 
  top 100 singles. Two of the top 10 songs (&quot;Unwell&quot; and &quot;Why Georgia&quot;) 
  there were in the top 10 here last year, so who knows what will happen in 2004. 
</p>
<p class="commentary">As usual, I give this disclaimer that this isn't highly 
  scientific and yes, you could probably convince me to shift stuff around in 
  the 30s, but that's not the point. The top five are definitely ranked perfectly.
