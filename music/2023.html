   <h1 align="center">Top 10 of 2023</h1>

   <p>As I'm not trying to do this via any kind of social media this year (pretty happy to be
      avoiding it), I'm doing video links for each song. Please note these links were 
      accurate mid-December 2023, but may have gone out of date since.</p>

   <!--
   <p>Since I'm not bothering with any social media this year (honestly, I'm sick of what it
      has become), I'll write some commentary up here like I did years ago...</p>

   <p>Some things change; some things stay the same. It seems that four artists who've had
      year-end number ones on my past year-end lists make the top 10 this year, and a total of
      seven artists who've landed in year-end top fives in the past land something in this
      year's top 10. They're all great. The reach goes back all the way to "All The Small
      Things" landing #4 of 2000 (if we count beyond top five, it goes back to "Big Me" at #40 
      of 1996) to the artist behind my favorite song of last year landing
      two tracks in this year's top 10.</p>

   <p>The artist behind my number of the year landed a top five last year, but
      has been on my radar since buying her debut CD discovering her as an opener in December 
      2005; its single landed #86 of 2006. "The Story" charted in 2007 and its legacy far outlived
      its placement then. She rocked the Grammys this year with the winning song, and 
      <a href="https://wyep.org">my local
      station</a> has been playing it lots, rightfully so. Speaking of which, said station did a
      cool Summer Music Fest, one result of which is at #7, the only artist never to place on
      on of these lists before.</p>

   <p>Enjoy!</p>
