<p class="commentary">If you're surprised at what lands at the top of my year, 
  you don't know me. It's fitting that Yellowcard should have the #1 album of 
  the year. It spawned three #1 singles: &quot;Way Away,&quot; &quot;Ocean Avenue,&quot; 
  and &quot;Only One,&quot; but those aren't the only good ones on the album. 
  Really, everything's quite good. Nevermind that it was released last year; it 
  was undoubtedly the album I've listened to the most this year. In addition to 
  the <i>Ocean Avenue</i> disc being great, I saw the band do two great live shows 
  this year. The <i>Beyond Ocean Avenue: Live at the Electric Factory</i>, recorded 
  the day after one of those shows, is also definitely worth checking out. </p>
<p class="commentary">There were a lot of albums on here that were released last 
  year, there are a few I discovered after the fact, and then there are four CDs 
  I waited to buy right when they were released. Let's go through those, in order...</p>
<p class="commentary">New Found Glory has been one of those bands that always 
  gets associated with the bands I like, but they failed to put out a song I really 
  got into until this year. When I first heard &quot;All Downhill From Here,&quot; 
  I honestly expected it to fade away like the rest. Something about it got it 
  stuck in my head when I was listening to it in the car in May. Add to that the 
  fact that that really overpriced music store in the Altoona mall was playing 
  the whole CD a few days early when I spent a good chunk of time there one afternoon. 
  That advertising worked, except I had to wait a while to be able to buy it... 
  and then it became one of the things I didn't stop listening to all summer. 
</p>
<p class="commentary">Next up, we have a late June release. It was the Yellowcard 
  news page that first informed me of the <i>Spider-Man 2</i> soundtrack. There 
  were too many good names on there to pass it up... and it turned out to be a 
  good compilation throughout. Nevermind that so few of the songs actually got 
  played in the movie... but that's a separate rant from months ago... </p>
<p class="commentary">Green Day's September return got a lot of press. I kept 
  hearing about this concept of a &quot;punk rock opera,&quot; and I'm still not 
  sure I get it, but it's got something to do with the politcs on the album. The 
  critics seem to think this was the best Green Day album; I like <i>nimrod </i>and 
  <i>Warning</i> better, but it definitely has its place in the 2004 recap. (You're 
  hearing the best song on the radio right now though.)</p>
<p class="commentary">Then we have what has to be the biggest marketing hype ever 
  for a CD's release, and I can't say I minded. U2's 14th album was slated for 
  release on November 23 (my birthday, by the way) and that was preceded by months 
  of &quot;Vertigo&quot;-themed iPod ads. Multiple radio stations were spinning 
  the whole disc before its release (and I still hear &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; 
  getting airplay despite it not being an official single) and I could tell it 
  was going to be good. A month later, I've decided it's the best U2 album I've 
  heard. It might not quite have anything like the gems of the '80s that made 
  the band big, but it's the strongest CD throughout. </p>
