      <p>I know I've had the simplest of setups for recent lists; this said, I decided it was much less stressful
         to write this from scratch than risk logging into GitHub and risk being told I have to play games with being
         texted a silly code and my password isn't good enough. The idea of silly bonus codes after passwords stresses
         me out beyond recognition and it's one of the many stupid things about the 2020s...</p>

      <p>Music makes me feel good as it always has. 
         Great music like what'll share helps a  lot with the stresses of 2020s stressful life! 
         I've posted mid-year lists in places in the past, but not here. I 
         feel it's due this year, as the first half of the year has been promising for music a lot! </p>

      <p>And before anyone criticizes my choosing a song that officially came out as a single on June 28 as the 
         far-and-away best song of the year, I've had it since February due to a crowdfunding thing that produced a great
         album! And there's much great music so far to make one feel good, so... </p>


      <p>I did identify enough great singles to assemble a top 15, but the rest are more from artists who have
         already appeared. So, I'll leave it at this, and see what the rest of the year has in store...</p>
