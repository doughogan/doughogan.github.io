            - Two activities to experience Kafka Fundamentals firsthand:

<ul>
<li>
An activity that leads you through signing up for Confluent Cloud, setting up the Confluent Cloud CLI on your machine, and using it to create a topic, produce, and consume
</li>
<li>
An activity that has you work in a Gitpod workspace that is already set up for you with three terminal panes. You will create a topic, produce, and consume to start. Then you will observe partitioning and two different kinds of offsets. There are a few enrichment sections to explore a few more concepts that came up in the Fundamentals course.
