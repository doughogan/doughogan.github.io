You should come in with a background in the basics of classes, recursion, efficiency, and data structures such as linked lists, trees, stacks, and queues. In turn, I expect that you'll have mastered CS1 content, e.g. sequence, selection, repetition, methods, arrays, and files. </p>  <p align="left">You are not advised to schedule a heavy course load (e.g. &gt;= 17 credits) while taking this course. While to be successful at any endeavor requires being able to give it time and attention, students who've not met success in this course in the past had too many obligations at once. </p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <h2 align="left"><a name="catalog"></a>Catalog Description</h2>  <p align="left">This course will continue with object-oriented programming and will introduce graphics, virtual machines, programming language concepts and web-based programming using Java. </p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <h2 align="left"><a name="goals"></a>Learning Goals </h2>  <p>This course will be centered around three major units: </p>  <ul>    <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>    <li>Graphical User Interfaces and Event-Driven Programming</li>    <li>Databases </li>  </ul>  <p>In addition, some smaller topics related to the above topics and programming with the web in mind will be interweaved within the major units.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2 align="left"><b> <a name="text"></a>Textbook</b></h2><p>The textbook is optional, and the newest edition is very similar to the previous, so either of these would serve you well: </p>  <ul>    <li>Deitel, Paul and Harvey Deitel. <em>Java How to Program.</em> 8th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2010.<br>    (ISBN 0136053068) </li>    <li>Deitel, Paul and Harvey Deitel. <em>Java How to Program. </em>9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2012.<br>(ISBN 0132575663) </li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2 align="left"><a name="materials"></a>Other Materials </h2><ul>  <li>Class notes: I will provide notes on many topics on this web page. It is my hope that you'll use my notes, your notes taken in class, and the textbook in conjunction with each other. </li>  <li>Java compiler. We will have <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> available in the lab and also  use the command line <span class="style2">javac</span> compiler. </li>  <li>See the &quot;Resources&quot; link in the header above for other texts I may reference and web resources. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><b><a name="attendance"></a>Class Attendance, Participation, and Conduct </b></h2><p>Attendance is expected of all students at all classes. Those who attend all classes will experience the greatest success on exams and assignments. Announcements and information dispensed during class supercede any other information. However, there are occasional legitimate reasons why students may miss class. Some leniency is worked into the grading policy to account for this; no makeup labs or quizzes are given. </p><p>If unusual circumstances prevent you from attending class, it is expected that you will email or visit the instructor during office hours no later than the afternoon prior to your expected absence. </p><p>All students are expected to abide by the following rules for class (barring any emergencies): </p><ul>  <li> Arrive to class prior to the beginning of your scheduled section and be seated when class officially begins. (Plan  so that you never arrive late. Late arrivals are disruptive to  class and cause you to miss the feedback from previous assignments that is just as important as new content; therefore, they are treated the same as absences in terms of grading.) </li>  <li>Be present and pay attention during lectures. Remain seated throughout the duration of lecture; do not move around the room or disrupt the lecture in any way.</li>  <li>During lectures, pay attention to the lecture. If your monitor is on, view the class notes or be working on in-class problems when directed. Do not type during lecture, work on assignments for this class or any other, surf the web, etc. </li>  <li> During lectures, keep your cell phone away and in a quiet mode. </li>  <li>Actively participate in work for this course during lab time. </li>  <li>Respect the classroom and your neighbors. Treat the equipment with respect. Don't bring food into the classroom. </li></ul><p>Attendance sheets will be circulated and monitored and attendance will count toward the grade starting the third week (after drop/add is over) and will be taken on all days except the days of Exam 1 and Exam 2, when project demonstrations will be happening. To be considered fully present for a class, you must abide by the six rules above for that class. The number of such classes, of which 24 are possible, are tallied and this number determines your eligibility for various grades. </p><p>You are expected to participate in activities during class and complete  occasional  assignments that are not formally graded. These factors don't have points attached to them, but do have small effects on grades. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="programs"></a>Programming Assignments </h2><p>There are two kinds of programming activities in this course: </p><ul>  <li>Labs, which occur during most classes, are generally designed to be a place for you to practice and apply the contents of the most recent lecture(s), give you your initial experience in the content, and be a tool to be used for you to master the fundamentals of the course. </li>  <li>Projects, which occur at the culmination of each unit, are designed to be a place where you tie many skills together in a larger-scale activity,  allow assessment of whether you have mastered the skills emphasized in the labs, and sometimes require some independent learning. </li></ul><p>Details on each will follow below. </p><h3>Labs and Portfolio</h3><p>Here is how labs will generally go: </p><ol>  <li>A new lab is assigned each Tuesday and Thursday. Sometimes there will be class time to begin work on it; sometimes there will not. You should allocate time in your Tuesday/Thursday schedule to complete the lab. We will aim to provide some extra out-of-class support on these days than other days of the week.</li>  <li>You are expected to take your work on the lab very seriously, strictly adhere to the <a href="style.php">Programming Assignment Guidelines</a>, and apply lessons you've learned from previous labs in completing first drafts of new labs. You will prepare a lab report using the <a href="report-lab00.doc">Lab Report Template</a>, print it using both sides of the paper, and staple it when you are done. </li>  <li>You will turn in your lab report within 24 hours of the end of your class meeting under the instructor's office door (unless you complete it when the instructor is in the lab). Note that the CSE wing of the third floor is  accessible to students only between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.</li>  <li>Your lab will be assessed both by marking your paper and by assessing relevant areas of the Programming Assignment Guidelines using a check sheet that correlates to the guidelines. On the check sheets, you'll see the following markings: </li>  <ul>    <li>Checks, meaning the work indicates understanding in an area and adherence to the guideline. </li>    <li>Check-minuses, meaning the work indicates some progress in an area but is deficient or incomplete in some way.</li>    <li>Xs, meaning the work indicates either having ignored something explicitly written in the guideline or having failed to understand that area. </li>  </ul>  <li>Check sheets will occasionally note that you are required to follow up with a member of the course staff for assistance with something about your lab. Failure to do so in a timely fashion has negative grade implications, as the goal of this follow-up is to help correct problems before they add up. </li>  <li>Labs will be returned to you either during the next class or the Monday recitation section the following week. Sometimes, there will be in-class feedback during the next class; most Mondays will involve going over the solution to the labs from the previous week. </li>  <li>You will revise your work using the written feedback and the feedback from class. You are welcome to conference with the course staff as you revise. When you do, we'll make note on your check sheet. If you have revised a lab such that it is flawless, the instructor (only) will mark it as such on your check sheet.</li>  <li> Ultimately, you'll assemble a group of labs into a mini-portfolio, which is assessed for a grade (a letter grade). When you turn in a mini-portfolio, it must be in a three-ring binder and be set up as follows:      <ul>        <li>There must be a title page at the front (or behind plastic of a view binder) that includes at least a title, your name, your section, and your email address. </li>        <li>There must be labeled tabbed dividers delimiting the labs.</li>        <li>Labs must be arranged in chronological order from first to last.</li>        <li>Within sections for labs, the latest (best) draft must be first, followed by all other drafts of the lab from the most recent revision to the initial draft. </li>      </ul>  </li></ol><p>Here are some exceptions to the usual flow of labs and how unusual individual cases are handled:</p><ul>  <li>Occasionally, a lab is not graded via the revision system, but is instead turn in once for assessment. This is planned to happen for a very short lab, for a lab that culminates the core new content of the course, and may otherwise happen with advance announcement. </li>  <li>Occasionally, it is announced in class that a lab is due before the end of that class, if it is very short. </li>  <li>If you fail to turn in a lab before the deadline, it is late, and marked as such. </li>  <li>If you turn in a lab that indicates a lack of effort in some areas of the assignment guidelines, it will be returned to you without feedback. (This would happen due to matters of carelessness such as very poor indentation, failure to use data dictionaries, failure to document methods, or submitting code in a proportional-width font.) After the introduction unit of the course is done, all such labs are treated the same as late labs. </li>  <li>As labs are designed to reinforce material taught in class, any attempt to solve a lab using any concepts not taught in class is an attempt to circumvent the problem at hand and avoid learning the tools taught in class. Such labs are returned without full feedback and treated the same as late/missed labs, except that they may also lead to academic integrity violations. </li>  <li>In the latter three cases, you may make a late/second submission of the lab on the Monday following the deadline, with &quot;Late Initial Submission&quot; handwritten in the top right of the first page, either during recitation or under the instructor's door by noon. Understand that the lab system is not designed for such labs during the day-to-day flow of the semester; feedback may not occur at all or in a timely fashion, but submissions in this manner create the greatest likelihood of feedback on missed labs. </li>  <li>A mini-portfolio with more than one late lab or lab requiring resubmission almost always earns a grade no higher than a &quot;D.&quot; The same applies to a late mini-portfolio. More details on lateness are given below. </li></ul><p>Finally, you are to keep all of the labs from the mini-portfolios together in a larger overall portfolio set up in exactly the same way. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Projects</h3><p>Each unit culminates with a project that ties the skills of the unit together. Here are some notes on the projects:</p><ul>  <li>Project 0 is much larger than any lab and much smaller than any other project. It culminates the introductory unit and is designed to draw heavily upon your background skills as well. It may vary from the other projects in other ways as well.</li>  <li>Project 1 ties together all of the work in the OOP unit and is designed to be a place where you take advantage of inheritance and polymorphism. </li>  <li>Project 2 ties together all of the work in the graphics and GUI unit and allows you to use both together.</li>  <li>Project 3 focuses on databases and JDBC but brings the course together in that it is where you build a GUI system to interact with a database. It is also a team project.</li>  <li>In Units 1 and 2, there will be a mini-portfolio of content that precedes the projects. The skills in this mini-portfolio are basic skills for the unit you need to have mastered in order to be successful on the projects. As such, when you begin the projects and meet their intermediate milestones depends on how you do on the mini-portfolio. Related, project grades are influenced by mini-portfolio grades. This system is in place in hopes of preventing students from failing projects by taking on too much at once. </li></ul><p>Here are some project policies:</p><ul>  <li>Projects will require reports and electronic submissions. Projects 1, 2, and 3 will also require live demonstrations. </li>  <li> Projects are not revised or graded in the portfolio system like the labs are. One grade is assessed based on the final project submission. </li>  <li>Projects are graded using a letter-grade system. </li>  <li>Late projects are handled as follows:      <ul>        <li>The project may be handed in up to 72 hours late. Turn in such projects during one of the instructor's office hours if possible. Otherwise, email to find out when to turn in the project. </li>        <li>The project is eligible for grades of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; only.</li>        <li>The project will not get the benefit of the same detailed review and feedback as on-time projects. The grade will likely not be available until later, but no later than the Thursday before the late drop deadline. </li>      </ul>  </li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Grading </h3><p>In each unit, you will earn a programming grade, computed as follows and reported on a 4.0 scale:</p><ul>  <li>The grades on the mini-portfolio(s) and any labs from the unit not included in the mini-portfolio(s) will be averaged together with weights determined by their effort and importance. This lab grade counts for 50% of the unit's programming grade. </li>  <li>The project grade counts for 50% of the unit's programming grade. </li></ul><p>The four unit programming grades are used to compute an overall programming grade, using the following weighted average scale:</p><ul>  <li>Unit 0: 10%</li>  <li> Unit 1: 30%</li>  <li>Unit 2: 30%</li>  <li>Unit 3: 30% </li></ul><p>The number of late labs (or labs requiring resubmission) is recorded and tallied for each student. It is handled as follows:</p><ul>  <li>Everyone is human. Therefore one late lab is allowed per student without grade penalty.</li>  <li>Beyond that, the first late lab reduces the grade by 0.1, the second reduces the grade by an additional 0.2, the third reduces the grade by an additional 0.3, etc. </li></ul><p>The overall portfolio is collected near the end of the course and assessed a grade. It has implications as follows:</p><ul>  <li>If the portfolio grade is more than a letter above or below the programming grade otherwise earned, the instructor will consider the student's overall course grade on an individual basis beyond the grading scale. This allows some reward for significant improvements over the course of the semester and also prevents any invalidation of the grading system wherein a student earn a numeric grade non-representative of his/her skill set. </li>  <li>Portfolio grades may affect rounding decisions in any case. </li></ul><p>Finally, if a student fails to attempt any of Projects 1, 2, or 3, his/her programming grade is automatically an &quot;F.&quot;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><a name="exams"></a>Exams and Quizzes </h2><p>There are three exams:</p><ul>  <li>Exam 1, covering Unit 1, given at 8:15 p.m. on 2/16/2012 in 26 Holser, and worth 100 points</li>  <li>Exam 2, covering Unit 2, given at 8:15 p.m. on 3/29/2012 in 26 Hosler, and worth 100 points</li>  <li>Exam 3, covering the entire course but heavily emphasizing Unit 3, given during finals week, and worth 125 points</li></ul><p>There will be 4-8 short, unannounced quizzes given in class. Each of these will be worth 10 points. The lowest quiz score will be dropped. No make-up quizzes will be given. </p><p>The number of points you earn on all exams and quizzes will be divided by the total possible number of points to determine your percentage grade for exams. This grade is converted to a letter grade using roughly the following scale:</p><ul>  <li>90% and up: A-/A</li>  <li>80-89%: B-/B/B+</li>  <li>70-79%: C/C+</li>  <li>60-69%: D</li>  <li>0-59%: F</li></ul><p>The exact cutoffs may shift at the discretion of the instructor. </p><h3>Conflict Exams </h3><p>If you have a conflict with a scheduled evening exam, print out a copy of the <a href="conflict_exam.htm">conflict exam form</a> and turn it in to the instructor two weeks prior to the exam. More details are on the form itself. Failure to attend an exam without having previously filed a conflict exam form (and followed up with communication from the instructor regarding the conflict exam) will result in an automatic zero for the exam. </p><p>Final exam conflicts must be filed through the University Registrar's office. Those students who do not file for a conflict exam through the Registrar's office will not be permitted to take the final exam. Wait until the final exam schedule is posted to make travel plans during finals week. </p><h3>Exam Policies </h3><p>The following policies apply to exams:</p><ul>  <li>You must bring your PSU photo ID or photo driver's license.</li>  <li>Complete exams in pencil. </li>  <li>Calculators, books, notebooks, etc. are not allowed. </li>  <li>Cell phones, MP3 players, CD players, etc. are not allowed, as per University policy. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="grade"></a>Determining Your Course Grade </h2><p>Ordinarily, the course grade is a weighted average of the following:</p><ul>  <li>Exams and quizzes grade: 50% </li>  <li>Programming grade: 50% </li></ul><p>This number will almost always fall between two established letter grades. Distance from an established letter grade is one factor in determining which letter grade is assigned. Class participation, attendance, and effort are bigger factors. </p><p>There are three matters that could otherwise affect grades: </p><ul>  <li>Portfolio performance: As noted above. </li>  <li>Attendance problems: If a student does not attend a percentage of classes that falls in same letter grade range determined above or higher, a lower grade will be assigned. Such a grade is determined at the discretion of the instructor depending on the severity of the attendance problem.</li>  <li>Inconsistent performance on exams and assignments: If there is more than a 1.0 difference between the two grades, a grade lower than the average will be assigned at the discretion of the instructor. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><a name="honesty"></a>Academic Honesty</h2><p>The work you turn is to be YOUR own work. You are welcome to discuss take-home coursework with classmates, but the work you turn in is to be your own. Here are some considerations:</p><ul>  <li>Copying someone else's work is subject to penalty. </li>  <li>Programs may not be copied from the Internet, textbook, or any other source.</li>  <li>In labs, you may not use any Java programming techniques not taught in this course. Not only have you likely not had formal training in alternate techniques, but more importantly, doing so circumvents the goal of the assignment and the spirit of the course. </li>  <li> The previous bullet point applies to projects as well, except that you are allowed to (and sometimes expected to) use methods and classes from the Java API if you cite the source. Other sources may be allowed only if you have cleared their use with the instructor in advance and cited them appropriately. </li>  <li>If you obtain assistance from anyone other than the instructor or the TA, such as a tutor, you must acknowledge the source in the header comments of your assignment. </li>  <li>Fabrication of program output constitutes an academic integrity violation and will be treated as seriously as any other kind of academic integrity offense. </li>  <li>Collaboration on quizzes and exams or using unauthorized aids is strictly forbidden. </li>  <li>Signing the honor code on exams is like signing a legal document. If you lie, you are violating academic integrity. </li></ul><p>Penalties for academic integrity violations are as follows: </p><ol>  <li>First offense on a single lab initial submission: reduction of the course grade by one level of a letter grade (e.g. from &quot;B+&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and an automatic rounding down of the course grade).</li>  <li>First offense on a quiz: automatic zero and loss of quiz drop privilege</li>  <li>First offense on an exam: automatic zero for the exam.</li>  <li> First offense on a project: automatic F for the project plus reduction of the project average by 1.83 (mathematically equivalent of earning a zero on one of three projects, taking into account that there is a vast difference between an &quot;F&quot; and a zero) and the requirement of completing additional work at the discretion of the instructor to retain liability to pass the course. </li>  <li>Second offense of any kind, any offense involving the portfolio, or any act of dishonesty that endangers another student's grade: automatic F for the course </li></ol><p>In all cases, an official academic integrity form is filed with the College of Engineering Dean's office and remains as part of your academic record university-wide. Such reports have implications beyond one course: if your record indicates that you've had prior academic integrity offenses in other courses, an academic integrity committee may direct an instructor who files an academic integrity form in another course to issue a stronger penalty. </p><p>In cases #3, #4, and #5, you will also be forbidden from dropping the course. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 align="left"><a name="other"></a>Other Expectations and Policies</h2><ul>  <li class="bodytext"><b>Grading Questions:<br>  </b>If you have questions about grades, you must deal with them as follows:  <ul>    <li>If points have been mistotaled on an assignment or a grade has been misrecorded, simply bring the graded assignment to the office during office hours within one week of the graded assignment being returned or the grade report being issued and I'll fix the error. </li>    <li>If you feel something has been graded incorrectly and wish to have the grade reconsidered, write up on a separate sheet specifically what is in question and why you think your solution is correct, and why you think the grade is wrong. Then staple this sheet on top of the graded assignment and turn it in to the instructor's office within one week of the date the graded assignment was returned. Note that you are making a gamble in challenging a grade: If you make a request that indicates further failure to understand what was being assessed or is completely unreasonable, I will deduct a level of a letter grade from the assignment. </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li class="bodytext"><b>Grades and IM:<br>  </b>I will NOT discuss grades over Instant Messenger. </li>  <li class="bodytext"><strong>Email: <br>    </strong>When emailing questions, please be as detailed as possible. Some source code issues may be more complicated than can reasonably resolved via email and may require office visits. While I make no guarantees about coding issues via email, you are most likely to get a response if you both attach the source code AND copy and paste the relevant lines of code into the body of the email. Also, when dealing with errors, copying and pasting exact compiler errors may sometimes be helpful. Finally, while I'll try my best to respond to email and generally check email often, messages sent in the evening or on the weekends may not receive a response until the next day or Monday. </li>  <li class="bodytext"><b>Check your email daily:</b><br>I'll send out many announcements by email and will consider anything announced by email official. Clarifications, hints, announcements, changes in policies and deadlines, etc. will be sent over email and I'll assume that you'll read such emails within 24 hours during the week.</li>  <li class="bodytext"><b>Email etiquette:</b><br>When emailing me with course-related questions, include <b>CMPSC 221 </b> or <b>CMPSC221 </b>(case doesn't matter) in the subject line. This ensures I'll see and reply to your message as quickly as possible. When asked to &quot;reply&quot; to a class announcement, <b>reply</b> and do NOT alter the subject line. (If assignment directions dictate a specific spacing, spaces do matter because of automatic processing.)</li>  <li class="bodytext"><b>Students with Exceptionalities:</b> <br>  If you have a disability-related need for modifications in your testing or learning situation, notify me during the first week of classes. You will be asked to present documentation from the <a href="http://www.equity.psu.edu/ods/" target="_blank">Office of Disability Services</a> (116 Boucke, 863-1807) that describes the nature of your disability and the recommended remedy. </li>  <li><b>Non-Discrimination:</b> <br>  It is my policy (and a university policy as well) not to discriminate against any person because of age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, gender, national origin, race, religious creed, sexual orientation, or veteran status. </li>  <li><b>Be Organized:<br>  </b>Keep all of your assignments. I recommend keeping all of your work for this class in one directory on your PSU PASS space or a flash drive you bring to class. Some assignments will be cumulative and build on previous assignments; you may be asked to alter a previous assignment during a lab or major assignment. </li>  <li><span class="bodytext"><b>Ask Questions:</b> <br>Please do not hesitate to ask questions in class or during office hours. My job is to help you learn the material. </span></li>  <li><strong>Plan Project Work Responsibly:</strong><br>    You are given multiple days to complete projects because they are not designed to be completed in one sitting. Start project work the day it is assigned or the next day. Do not expect support on projects within 24 hours of the deadlines. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font size="1"><a href="#timeplace">Time/Place</a> &#0149; <a href="#instructor">Instructor</a> &#0149; <a href="#prereq">Prereq.</a> &#0149; <a href="#catalog">Description</a> &#0149; <a href="#goals">Goals</a> &#0149; <a href="#text">Textbooks</a> &#0149; <a href="#materials">Materials</a> &#0149; <a href="#attendance">Attendance</a> &#0149; <a href="#deadlines"></a><a href="#programs">Programs</a> &#0149; <a href="#deadlines"></a><a href="#exams">Exams</a> &#0149; </font><font size="1"><a href="#grade">Grading</a> &#0149; <a href="#honesty">Acad.
