      <h1>CMPSC 221 Notes</h1>

      <p>I'm posting here lecture notes I developed in 2009 and maintained over the Fall 2009
         to Spring 2012 for the CMPSC 221 course at Penn State. This is a course in 
         object-oriented programming, graphics, event-driven programming, GUIs, and relational
         database basics in SQL and JDBC. The target language is Java. This course is/was the third
         in the introductory programming sequence. The first two were in C++; this course begins 
         with a transition to Java given programming background in C++ (with a bias toward C). 
      </p>

      <p>To be sure, some things have changed in the last decade. Applets have become deprecated;
         arguably they were sluggish back then. I could imagine converting everything to 
         applications and <font face="monospace">JFrame</font>s, but my goal is to share these 
         resources for self-education. Maybe someday.
      </p>

      <p>The course has three major units and a short introductory unit transitioning to Java:</p>

      <ul> 
         <li><a href="unit0/">Unit 0: Transition to Java from C++</a></li>
         <li><a href="unit1/">Unit 1: Object-Oriented Programming</a></li>
         <li><a href="unit2/">Unit 2: Graphics, Event-Driven Programming, and GUIs</a></li>
         <li><a href="unit3/">Unit 3: Basics of Relational Databases, SQL, and JDBC</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>I used the  Deitel and Deitel <i>Java: How to Program</i> series as an optional
         textbook along the way. Any textbook references refer to the 10th edition of that book.
      </p>

      <p>I have also shared the 
         <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus from the last time I taught it at PSU</a>
      </p>

      <p>I have numerous labs to accompany the material available, along with projects and old
         exams with solutions. Email me via my gmail address, user 
         <font face="monospace">doug.hogan</font> with corrections or requests for labs, etc.  
         Eventually, I hope to get more accompanying materials online and consumable.
