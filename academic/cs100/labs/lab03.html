      <h1>CS 100 Lab 3: Text and Images</h1>

      <p>The goal of this lab is to put into practice ideas from last Friday's lecture 
         and continue using previous skills. </p>


      <p>Complete these tasks:</p>
      <ol>
         <li><b>Align Text: </b> Go to your home page (index.html). Take the text at bottom
             before the horizontal rule and make it right-aligned.</li>
         <li><b>Add Color: </b> Set the background color of you home page to be something
             other than white. (Select so that the text is readable or change the default
             text color too.) Furthermore, make the text at the bottom of your page below
             the horizontal rule be in a different color from the rest.</li>
         <li><b>Add A New Section: </b> At the bottom of you home page, create a new section
             called "A Typical Day" with a sensible heading size. In this section, start 
             with a paragraph where you say "My typical day starts like this:" and follow
             it with a numbered list of at least 2 things you do in the morning. Then have 
             another paragraph along the lines of "Once I arrive to campus, then I do these
             things." Below that, have another numbered list, where the numbering picks up 
             where you left off, and you list at least three more things.</li>
         <li><b>Add an Image: </b> You have two choices here:
             <ul>
                <li>Put a picture of yourself, reasonably sized, at the top of your home
                    page. (I figure most of you have phones with cameras and can email 
                    yourself a photo, or get a classmate to take your picture now.)</li>
                <li>Add a computer-generated figure: Either use Word's Equation Editor to
                    generate some equation, explore Word's or PowerPoint's drawing features 
                    to draw something simple, or draw something simple using another
                    application. Take a screen shot where you capture <i>only the relevant
                    content</i>, and add this to your home page in a way that makes 
                    sense.</li>
             </ul>
         </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Use the TA for help as you go. Listen for TA announcements; make sure you get credit
         for completing the lab.</p>

      <p>If you've completed the lab as above (and only if the TA has told you you've done
         so satisfactorily to get a check for the day), you may opt to do both of the 
         following, additionally, to go for a check-plus:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Complete whichever image option above in #4 you didn't choose too.</li>
         <li>Add a small outline about something to a new section of your home page (or a 
             separate page if that makes more sense) by nesting lists within lists. 
             You must have three levels with two items (or more) each.
             You must have the top level hierarchy use Roman numerals, e.g. "I" and "II."
             Your second level must use capital letters, e.g. "A" and "B." You third level
             must use Arabic numerals, e.g. "1" and "2." </li>
      </ol>
