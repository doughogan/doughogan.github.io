      <h1>CS 100 Lab 1: Basic HTML</h1>

      <p>This lab is designed to be all about practicing the content of 
         <a href="../../html/notes-cs100-week1.php">Friday's lecture</a>. As such, you'll put 
         together a short page.</p>

      <p>Follow these instructions:</p>

      <ol>
         <li>Create a directory called <b>cs100</b> on your lab computer where you can
             store your work.</li>
         <li>Create a new HTML file in Notepad and save it as <b>index.html</b> in that
             directory.</li>
         <li>Set up the basic framework of your page. Make it so that the page's title 
             reads something like "(your name)'s CS 100 Home Page."</li>
         <li>Have your name be the top-level heading on your page.</li>
         <li>Beneath that, have three sections, each at the same level of hierarchy, with 
             titles and a paragraph beneath each: 
              <ul>
                 <li>My Background -- Write a paragraph telling where you're from and
                     some biographical information about what you did before you came to UIC.</li>
                 <li>What I'm Doing At UIC -- Write a paragraph telling what your major is,
                     why you chose it, what your goals are, etc.</li>
                 <li>What I've Learned In CS 100 So Far -- Here, just give a one-sentence
                     paragraph saying you're taking CS 100 and have learned conceptual
                     knowledge and some skills. Read on...</li>
              </ul>
         <li>Open your web page in a web browser and check that everything is working okay.</li>
         <li>Under the last section, give two lower-level headings: "Conceptual Information" and
             "Technical Skills." Write a paragraph beneath each, wherein you have at least one 
             sentence for each day of class except the first.</li>
         <li>Put a horizontal line at the bottom of your page. Beneath it, put your section number 
             on the first line and then the text "Last modified 01/25/2016." Don't put each of 
             these things in its own paragraph; there should be no blank vertical space between
             these lines.</li>
         <li>Of course, check your page in a browser as you edit.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Use the TA for help as you go. Listen for TA announcements; make sure you get credit
         for completing the lab.</p>
