      <h1>CS 100 Lab 5: Calculating Your GPA in Excel</h1>

      <p>The goal of this lab is to put into practice ideas from last Friday's lecture - particularly getting acquainted with Excel formulas. </p>

      <p>Your task is to calculate a GPA.      </p>
      <p>Do the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new Excel file. </li>
        <li>Put an appropriate title in cell A1. Make it larger than the normal text and make it bold so it stands out.</li>
        <li>In cells A3 through F3, put each of the following headings, in bold text:
          <ul>
            <li>Course number</li>
            <li>Course title</li>
            <li>Number of credits</li>
            <li>Letter grade</li>
            <li>Grade points</li>
            <li>Quality points</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Adjust column widths so all text is readable.</li>
        <li>Fill in cells A3 through A7 with the course numbers, e.g. CS 100, of 5 real or hypothetical college courses. You could use what you took last semester, you could use what you're taking this semester, or you could make things up. If you want to add more courses, that's fine.</li>
        <li>Fill in cells in column B with course titles. </li>
        <li>Fill in cells in column C with approprate numbers of credits. Even if all of your courses are 3 credits, make at least one be different.</li>
        <li>Fill in cells in column D with grades for these courses. They don't have to be real -- and to keep it interesting, do not fill in all the same grades (even if you're a star student). </li>
        <li>Manually fill in grade points in column E to match with grades to the left, where 'A' corresponds to 4, 'B' corresponds to 3, 'C' corresponds to 2,  'D' corresponds to 1, and 'F' corresponds to 0.</li>
        <li>In cell F4, calculate the quality points for the first course by multiplying the grade points by the number of credits, using a formula. </li>
        <li>Copy your formula down column F for all of your courses.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now do summary statistics and calculations:</p>
      <ol start="12">
        <li>In cell B12, put the text &quot;TOTALS.&quot; Make it italicized.</li>
        <li>In cell C12, put a formula to add up all of the numbers of credits for all of the courses you've filled in. (You <strong>must</strong> do this using the arithmetic operators from class Friday, even if you know of anything more advanced.)</li>
        <li>Copy your formula from C12 to F12. </li>
        <li>In cell B13, put the text &quot;GPA&quot; and make it italicized.</li>
        <li>In cell F13, give a formula to divide the total number of quality points by the total number of credits to calculate the GPA. Make this slightly larger, bold, and italicized. </li>
      </ol>
   <p>Experiment with changing grades and seeing calculated cells automatically updating.   </p>
