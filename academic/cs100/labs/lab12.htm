<h1><font color="#FF6600">Lab 12: SQL Queries with Two Tables</font></h1>
<p align="right"><font size="1">Last Modified 3/1/16</font></p>
<p>This lab builds on your last two labs. Here are your tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Edit your table of courses so that it also has a field for the course textbook. Use a foreign key to the books table to achieve this.</li>
  <li>Edit the data in your courses table to make all of the courses have an associated textbook, even if it's not really the book.</li>
  <li>Write a query using a subquery to display the full course numbers of all courses, along with the title, author, and cost of their textbooks.</li>
  <li>Write a second query that achieves the same objective as #3, but this time using an inner join.</li>
  <li>Now edit either query so that you only display 100-level courses and they are listed with the course with the most expensive book first, going down to the cheapest book.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like you did in the last lab, write down your queries for #3-#5 on paper and hand that in to the TA at the end.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Extra Task You Can Do for a Check-Plus</strong>: Set up a table of buildings like we did in class and populate it. Set up a table of course sections and populate it with at least 7 total sections and at least 2 courses with multiple sections. Then run a query to display a table with all sections of all courses with full course numbers, titles, section numbers, number of credits, textbook title, and textbook ISBN. Show the TA the result, but also write down this query. </p>
