<h1><font color="#FF6600">Lab 11: SQL Queries</font></h1>
<p align="right"><font size="1">Last Modified 3/1/16</font></p>
<p>This lab builds on your last lab. </p>
<p>Your tasks are to execute several queries. Since you can only put in one query at a time in Access and since you'll want to have something written down for studying/reference purposes, write down the SQL code for each query on a separate sheet of paper after you have executed in successfully. Turn in that paper at the end of lab.</p>
<p>As you try to execute these queries, you may find you don't have enough data to make them interesting. If that's the case, add more data to your tables as you go.</p>
<p>Here are the queries:</p>
<ol>
  <li>List all information about all books.</li>
  <li>List just the authors of all books.</li>
  <li>List all information about just the hardcover books. Sort this list in ascending order by title.</li>
  <li>List the titles, authors, and page counts of all books with at least 500 pages. Sort this information with the longest books at the top going down to the smallest.</li>
  <li>List all information about all books published between 1990 and 2000. </li>
  <li>List all information about all books published in 2000, 2002, 2015, or 2016. Do not use the keyword 'or' in your solution. </li>
  <li>List all information about the book with primary key 2.</li>
  <li>List the primary keys (only) of paperback books. </li>
</ol>
