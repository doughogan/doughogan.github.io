      <h1>CS 100 Lab 2: Lists and Links</h1>

      <p><b>Logistical note: </b>This lab is different from the rest because of Labor Day. We're allowing you the 
         <i>option</i> of doing it as a take-home lab so that you get practice on this material right after the
         lecture on it, given that we don't have classes on Labor Day. If you choose to do it over the weekend
         and want to get credit for it now, you may bring it in to either TA office hour next week on a personal 
         laptop (T 11-1 or Th. 2-4). You may ignore it entirely and work on it during normal lab in Week 4. If you
         complete it early, you earn a week off in lab soon.</p>

      <p>The goal of this lab is to put into practice ideas from last Friday's lecture and continue using the 
         basic skills from the first HTML lecture. </p>


      <p>Pick a topic you find interesting. It could be a hobby, it could be something about your major, it 
         could be a favorite show or movie or the like, etc. The content doesn't matter; the technical 
         things you do do. </p>


      <p>Within the folder you created last week, make a new folder where you'll put pages about your selected 
         topic. Give it an appropriate name -- all lowercase, no spaces, descriptive. In this folder, 
         create a file called index.html. (See below for details.)</p>


      <p>Furthermore, create a second file in this new directory. It should have a top ten list relevant to your 
         topic, e.g. "Top Ten Reasons I Love ____" or "Top Ten Quotes from ____." Use the appropriate HTML tool 
         for your list. Have an appropriate heading and page title. Finally, create a link back to the index 
         page. </p>


      <p>In your index file:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Set up the basic framework of a page with a good title. </li>
         <li>Have a appropriate top heading. </li>
         <li>Give a paragraph or two describing your theme.</li>
         <li>Create a bulleted list containing two or three links to outside web sites related to your topic. </li>
         <li>Add a link to your top ten list page in your bulleted list or elsewhere on your page. </li>
         <li>Finally, at the very bottom of your page, give a horizontal rule and link back to your home page, 
             i.e., the one you made last week. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Use the TA for help as you go. Listen for TA announcements; make sure you get credit
         for completing the lab.</p>
