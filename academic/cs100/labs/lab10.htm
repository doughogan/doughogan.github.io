<h1><font color="#FF6600">Lab 10: Starting with Databases</font></h1>
<p align="right"><font size="1">Last Modified 3/1/16</font></p>
<p>This lab is just about getting started with Access and preparing some database tables you'll use in future labs. It follows from the class demo from Friday and experience from the class activity with the courses database a while back. </p>
<p>Here are your tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch Access and create a new <strong>Blank Desktop Database</strong> as per the demo in class.</li>
  <li>Create a database table called <strong>courses</strong> and set it up to contain the same fields as the one we did in class. Do all of the setup in Design View, providing descriptions for each of the fields (but you can copy mine).</li>
  <li>Switch over to Datasheet View and populate the courses table with information on 5 different courses.</li>
  <li>Go back to Design View and create a new table called<strong> books</strong>. It should allow us to specify the following about a book:
    <ul>
      <li>an ID (what's special about this?)</li>
      <li>title</li>
      <li>author</li>
      <li>whether the book is paperback or hardcover</li>
      <li>how many pages are in the book</li>
      <li>what year the book was published</li>
      <li>the book's publisher</li>
      <li>how much the book costs</li>
      <li>the book's ISBN</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Switch back to Datasheet View and add some book information. You must have information about 15 different books. Start with 5 real books, then either make up whatever you want for the rest or base them on slight changes to the existing books. For example, you might make a paperback edition of a hardcover book that costs less or an abridged edition that costs less and has fewer pages. Follow advice from the TA on any suggestions about your data. </li>
  <li>Recall our demo on how to get to query view from Friday. Go to the SQL View and run the following query: <br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select * from books</font>. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
