      <h1>CS 100 Lab 4: Your Schedule</h1>

      <p>The goal of this lab is to put into practice ideas from last Friday's lecture 
         and continue using previous skills. </p>

      <p>Your task is to use a table to present your typical weekly class schedule.</p>

      <p>Here are some requirements for everyone: </p>
      <ol>
         <li>You must create a new HTML document with an appropriate heading to contain your 
             schedule.</li>
         <li>You must have a link from your home page to this schedule page. Your must have a 
             link on your schedule page back to your home page.</li>
         <li>You must have a table with columns for each of Monday through Friday and a 
             header column for times of the day.</li>
         <li>You must have enough rows of your schedule to cover 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</li>
         <li>Header rows and columns of your table must be defined as such -- remember there's
             a tag that designates header rows separately from body rows.</li>
         <li>You must fill in at least 9 different cells of the table with events.</li>
         <li>The borders between cells must be visible.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Cell borders around empty draw strangely in some browsers. You can circumvent this
         by putting the text <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&amp;nbsp;</font> in
         empty cells.</p>

      <p>My strong suggestion is that you get the first three rows of the table set up and
         view those in a browser before trying to build the whole table. Furthermore, it's
         probably easiest to build an empty table first and then fill it in. Finally, after 
         you get a few rows working, it's smart to copy and paste the code for a generic 
         row of your table.</p>

      <p>Note that the exact times of classes don't have to be perfectly accurate for the
         purposes of this exercise. You have two options:</p>
      <ol>
         <li><b>Necessary for a Check: </b> Have a row for each hour of the day from 8 a.m.
             to 5 p.m.</li>
         <li><b>Necessary for a Check-Plus: </b> Have a row each half-hour of the day and join
             two neighboring cells for hour-long classes. Represent 75-minute classes as 
             90-minute events with three neighboring cells. (If you have things that are two
             hours or more, adjust accordingly.) You must have at least three things in your
             schedule that are more than an hour; you can "fake" the lengths of classes
             or you can add longer non-class events (say plug in a three-hour block of studying
             or sleeping or working somewhere).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Use the TA for help as you go. Listen for TA announcements; make sure you get credit
         for completing the lab.</p>
