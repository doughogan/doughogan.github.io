      <h1>CS 100 Lab 7: Improved GPA Calculation</h1>

      <p>We'll build on what you did in Lab 5 here. Open your spreadsheet from that lab.</p>
      <p>Somewhere out of the way from your existing content, add a group of cells that looks like this:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Letter</th>
            <th scope="col">Quality Points</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In your previous GPA spreadsheet, you had to enter the quality points for each grade by hand. Replace what was in those cells with a formula that automatically calculates the quality points using the table given. </p>
      <p>Then, somewhere below the GPA, program a formula that prints one of the following messages appropriately: (We'll define Dean's list as a GPA of at least 3.50 and a B average as being at least 3.0.)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;Congratulations, you made the Dean's List!&quot;</li>
        <li>&quot;Congratulations, you earned at least a B GPA!&quot;</li>
        <li>&quot;Have a good break!&quot; (for when neither congratulatory message is appropriate.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, add a column to the right of the last data column with heading &quot;Percentage of Total Credit Load&quot; and for each course, calculate this value by dividing the number of credits for each course by the total number of credits. Program <strong>one </strong>formula that you fill down through the column; do not program a different formula for each row. One of the values you use changes for each row and one stays the same. </p>
      <p>Add two more courses and grades and see the effects of changing the data without needing to change formulas.   </p>
