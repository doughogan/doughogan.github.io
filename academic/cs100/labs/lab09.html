      <h1>CS 100 Lab 9: Python 2</h1>

      <p>The goal of this lab is to put into practice ideas from last Friday's lecture. There
         were two main ideas: short IPO standalone programs and loops. You'll complete two 
         small programs, one for each idea.</p>

      <h2>Part I: Compound Interest</h2>

      <p>Recall the compound interest formula, which tells how much an investment is worth
         after interest has accumulated after a given number of periods:</p>
      <table width="100%" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
         <tr>
            <td width="100"><i><b>A<sub>n</sub></b></i><b> = 
               <i>P</i>(1+<i>i</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></b></td>
            <td><p>where:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><i>P</i> is the principal, or amount of money initially invested</li>
                  <li><i>i</i> is the interest rate per payment period as a fraction 
                      (0 &le; <i>i</i> &le; 1; 5% interest would be treated as 0.05 here)</li>
                  <li><i>n</i> is the number of payment periods</li>
                  <li><i>A<sub>n</sub></i> is the amount the investment is worth after interest 
                      has accrued on the given principal at the given interest rate after 
                      <i>n</i> payment periods</li>
               </ul>
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Your job is to write a short program that tells a user how much money he/she has
         in a savings account that earns interest monthly, after making an initial deposit,
         never withdrawing anything, and letting the interest grow. Use the IPO model. In  
         other words:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Have an input phase where you prompt the user for how much money was deposited,
             what the interest rate is, and how many months have passed. Remember to make your
             prompts clear. Store these values in three variables.</li>
         <li>Compute the value of the investment, using the formula above.</li>
         <li>Report your result to the user. Remember to label the units.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>


      <h2>Part II: Finding a Minimum</h2>

      <p>Write a short Python program that asks a user to input as many <b>postive</b> numbers
         as desired, using -1 to stop input. Report the minimum value entered.</p>

      <p>Hint: Look at all the example code snippets. This is meant to combine the ideas from 
         a few of them, with slight modifications.</p>

      <p>For check-plus, after you've achieved everything else, also tell how many values were 
         entered and how many of them were multiples of 10.</p>

      <p>Use the TA for help as you go. Listen for TA announcements; make sure you get credit
         for completing the lab.</p>
