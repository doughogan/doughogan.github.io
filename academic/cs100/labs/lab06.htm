<h3><font color="#FF6600">Background</font></h3>
<p>For this assignment, we'll work with an application from physics, specifically
optics. Here's a little background:</p>
<p>When light crosses through the boundary between two materials, it bends, a
  phenomenon known as <em>refraction. </em>The <em>index of refraction</em>,
  <em>n</em>, of a material is a measure of its optical density, i.e. how much
  the material distorts the speed of light traveling through
  it. </p>
<p>Snell's Law describes the nature of the refraction in terms of the following
  equation: <font color=#004080><B><em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> = <em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font>, where <font color=#004080><B>n<font size=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT></B></font> is
  the index of refraction for the first material and <font color=#004080><B>&theta;<font size=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT></B></font> gives the
  angle between a line normal to the boundary between materials 1 and 2. Similarly,
  <font color=#004080><B><em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font> is the
  index of refraction of the second material and <font color=#004080><B>&theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font> is the angle
  at which the light travels through the second material. Here is an illustration:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="snell.jpeg" width="98" height="83"></p>
<p>We'll work with some hypothetical data for five trials of a Snell's Law experiment
  where we're given two indices of refraction and the initial angle and we'll
  solve
  for the
  second
  angle. </p>
<h3><font color="#FF6600">Directions</font></h3>
<p>Program the correct formulas as directed. Refer to the list of functions from
  last class.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and open <strong>http://www.cs.uic.edu/~hogand/cs100/snell.xls</strong>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Put
      your name in cells B2. <br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>To convert an angle <em>x</em> in degrees to radians, multiply it by &pi;/180.
    Go to cell G7 and multiply the angle in F7 by this conversion factor. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Go to cell H7. Program a formula for the sine of the angle given in this
    line. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Go to cell I7. Here we want a formula for the left side of the Snell's
    Law equation. Multiply the first index of refraction, found in the column
    labeled <strong><em>n</em><sub>1</sub></strong>, by the sine of the first angle, which
    you just calculated and stored in H7. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Go to cell J7. Use the fact that <font color=#004080><B><em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> = <em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font> to program
    a formula for the appropriate quantity here. (Hint: this is the simplest
    formula in this assignment, yet you may overlook it due to its simplicity.
    Think back to our very first examples of formulas.)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Go to cell K7. Here we want the value of <font color=#004080><B>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font>, and we have <font color=#004080><B><em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font>in the previous
    column. Thus, to get<font color=#004080><B> sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font> here, we need
    to divide<font color=#004080><B><em> n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>sin &theta;<font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font>by <font color=#004080><B><em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font>. (Look
    to column E for the value of <font color=#004080><B><em>n</em><font size=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></B></font>.)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Now go to cell L7. Cell K7 should have the sine of the second angle from
    the last step. Here, we want to take the inverse sine of that number to find
    the second angle. Program the appropriate formula. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Go to cell M7. The last calculation gave us an angle in radians, but we'd
    like an angle in degrees. To convert an angle from radians to degrees, multiply
    it by 180/&pi;. Program that formula here. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We've completed all of the calculations for Trial 1. We'd like to do the
    same calculations for the other 4 trials. Program similar formulas in cells
    G8:M11. (That looks like a lot of work, but it's not. If you're spending
    more than a minute or two on this step, you're making it too hard.)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Now we'd like some summary data:
    <ol>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell F13, program a formula to find the <strong>average</strong> initial angle
        measurement of the five angles given in column F.</li>
        <li>In cell F14, program a formula for the <strong>smallest</strong> initial angle measurement
        of the five angles given in column F.</li>
        <li>  In cell F14, program a formula for the <strong>largest</strong> initial
        angle measurement of the five angles given in column F.          </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We'd like the same summary data for the angles in the new medium. Go to M13,
    M14, and M15 and program appropriate formulas. (Again, this step shouldn't
    take much time.)<br>
  </li>
</ol>
