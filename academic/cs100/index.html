    <font size="-1">All materials written by Doug Hogan, designed for part of a general compuer science 
       course. Some materials are based on materials I had developed for other courses, but all are 
       adapted to flow together in a course. Note that the course when last taught also included some
       conceptual content on computer science and some notes refer to some concepts that are assumed
       one would know from that content. Email: <i>doug.hogan AT gmail</i>
