<h2><font color="#336600"><a name="comments"></a>Some closing comments</font></h2><ul>  <li>There are a lot of heuristics given here and in prior notes. They are just that, heuristics,     i.e. guidelines. There are certainly places where they can be broken, but     for your purposes, don't. </li>  <li>Some of the tags we've looked at here can be given <i>attributes</i> that     add more specifications. For example, we can add to the paragraph tag to specify     alignments. We'll look at that in more detail next time.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
