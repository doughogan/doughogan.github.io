<h2><font color="#336600"><a name="obs"></a>Observations worth mentioning again </font></h2><ul>  <li>Notice that blank lines (whitespace) are ignored. It's good style to include whitespace because the HTML needs to be readable.</li>  <li>Notice that spaces are ignored if there's more than one of them at a time. You could put 20 spaces between words and it's the same as putting one. Tabs mean nothing.      <ul>        <li>There's a way around that called a non-breaking space, but there really isn't any place you'd need to -- or <i>should</i> -- use it.</li>        <li>Common mistake I've seen: <i>Do NOT</i> try to indent paragraphs with a bunch of non-breaking spaces. Paragraphs in HTML were never intended to be indented. It looks sloppy. </li>      </ul>  </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
