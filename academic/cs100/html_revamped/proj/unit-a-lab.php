Then: </p><ol>  <li>Change the level 1 heading so that it also includes your name.</li>  <li>Add a level 2 heading before the  background and interests sections for &quot;Basic Information.&quot; Here, include your class standing, birthdate, and hometown. For each of these, use bold text for the label and plain text for the response, e.g. "<b>Grade</b>: 12." Put each item on its own line using the line break tag, not the paragraph tag.</li>  <li>Edit your responses to all of the  biographical prompts. </li>  <li> Make sure everything else on your page works and proofread it. </li></ol></body></html>
