<h2><font color="#336600">Image Types</font></h2><p>Images on the web should be in one of the following two file formats:</p><ul>  <li>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) - *.gif</li>  <li>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) - *.jpg</li>
  <li>PNG (Portable Network Graphics) - *.png</li></ul><p>Prepare your images first. Put them in the same directory where you're making   your web page. One idea is to have an <strong>images</strong> subdirectory where you store all of your graphics. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font color="#336600">A Word on Web-Friendly Filenames </font></h3><p>Some guidelines for the names of all files you create for use on the web:</p><ul>  <li>Restrict filenames to <strong>lowercase</strong> letters, hyphens (better), underscores (worse), and digits. In other words, never use capital letters in spaces. </li>  <li><strong>NEVER</strong> use any spaces in filenames. Use hyphens to denote changes in words. </li>  <li>All files need proper extensions to work. </li></ul><p>These conventions come from history and the behavior of web servers. Web servers are case sensitive. Some have problems with uppercase letters. Just be clean and stick to lowercase. Also, spaces can be problematic. Finally, spaces add unnecessary complication to programming that can avoided by smart file-naming. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
