<p>You can set up your own web site via
   <a href="http://people.uic.edu/"><b>people.uic.edu</b></a>. The main page there is set up to 
   tell you how to do so, but I'll give a few notes here.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to activate your site. Underneath the large "Activate" 
   text, find the "Activate my site" button and click it.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><h1>lingering questions:</h1>
    <br>is there an FTP client in the lab? 
    <br>how does it work...
    <br>should put directions on how to use it here...
    <br>rest should be reviewed once that's in place...
