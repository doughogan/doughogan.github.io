<h2><font color="#336600">The basic framework</font></h2><p>The HTML file itself is all wrapped within an outer set of tags common to all   HTML files. Here's the basic framework (you could feasibly copy and paste this   each time you get started):</p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" width="11" align="center">  <tr>     <td>       <pre><font color="#333300"><b><font color="#333399">&lt;html&gt;</font></b></font>      <font color="#333399"><b>&lt;head&gt;</b></font>         <font color="#333399"><b>&lt;title&gt;</b></font>The title of your page goes here.<font color="#333399"><b>&lt;/title&gt;</b></font>      <font color="#333399"><b>&lt;/head&gt;</b></font>      <font color="#333399"><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></font>         The text that makes up your page goes here.      <b><font color="#333399">&lt;/body&gt;</font></b><b><font color="#333399">&lt;/html&gt;</font></b></pre>    </td>  </tr></table><p><a href="demo.html">What that page looks like</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font color="#336600">Observations</font></h3><ul>  <li>Notice that blank lines (whitespace) are ignored. It's good style to include     whitespace because the HTML needs to be readable.</li>  <li>Notice that spaces are ignored if there's more than one of them at a time.     You could put 20 spaces between words and it's the same as putting one. Tabs     mean nothing.     <ul>      <li>There's a way around that called a non-breaking space, but, at this point, there really         isn't any place you'd need to -- or <i>should</i> -- use it.</li>      <li>Common mistake I've seen: <i>Do NOT</i> try to indent paragraphs with         a bunch of non-breaking spaces. Paragraphs in HTML were never intended         to be indented. It looks sloppy. </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
